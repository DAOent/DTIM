Besides, the spread and prevalence of COVID-19 in recent years get people know the importance of diverse work modes. With this trend, the concept web3 steps out from its previous version web2.

Currently, most Web3 companies are still working with tools within Web2, such as Telegram, Discord, Google Drive, Enterprise WeChat, DingTalk, Lark, and etc, Which user's information and initiative are limited.

DAO-entrance is trying to create a safe, efficient, powerful and Web3-based instant collaboration tool, which is a breakthrough.
