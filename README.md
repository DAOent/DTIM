## Project Overview
We are creating a Web3 native, secure and powerful instant collaboration tool. To meet the basic office needs of DAO, this tool must be open, equal, decentralized, open and transparent, and sufficiently automated.

## Overview
We are committed to providing a de-centralized collaboration tool for all DAOs, and we have created a basic instant communication tool based on the matrix protocol. On the basis of instant messaging, we help more organizations or enterprises to create and operate DAOs quickly and efficiently by compatible with existing block chains or providing block chain services.

In the first phase, we provided ink-based! The DAO smart contract template, together with the substrate-based pallet template, facilitates the rapid integration and use of all substrate-based block chains. Compatibility with existing DAOs in this non-intrusive way will help more people and enterprises create their own DAOs, create and run TEE-based privacy computing programs.

The second phase will help enterprises publish their own DAOs, provide DAO-DAO/Enterprise-DAO  chains, and provide a distributed privacy computing platform based on block chain and TEE.

## Project Details
Our long-term goal is to create a secure, private and efficient DAO in three steps for the enterprise/block chain and Web3 people. Members can communicate, agree, produce and settle efficiently through our tools.

First, we offer a team collaboration tool similar to slack and based on the matrix protocol, designed for modern devices and compatible with devices such as window/mac/linux/android/ios.

In the form of a common rendering engine based on flutter and web, our client is compatible with most DAPPs and can run faster. The core business will be implemented by flutter widgets, and DAPP will be rendered by DAPP web engine.

Our client is a non-intrusive client that supports layer1 block chain/layer2 smart contracts and is dedicated to adapting DAO scenarios. As an initial stage, we will improve our clients, and at the same time, we will gradually create a fully autonomous de-centralized organization called DAO-entrance.DAO-entrance based on substrate and concurrent use of DAO governance. Through the internal requirements of our DAO and the continuous introduction of other DAOs. We'll use substrate pallet and ink! Smart Contracts provide a quick DAO solution for Polkadot Ecology.

Our clients have the following characteristics in communication:
1. Unlimited messaging within and between organizations
2. Open and non-public channels with no barriers to project communication
3. Unlimited VoIP chat
4. End-to-end message encryption
5. Block Chain Control Robot
6. Multilingual SDK customizable robots with unlimited scalability
7. Code open source without security risk, no advertising, no fees
8. Communications are distributed and organizations have their own organizational nodes
9. Seamless integration with DAO Governance, DAO Consortium, DAO Projects
10. Polkadot wallet login

DAO-entrance is committed to providing complete collaboration tool software for DAOs. First, the tool will guide the DAO to set up a core team that will be authorized to make decisions on some of the DAO's daily affairs so as to avoid endless voting. Community empowered core teams to manage daily affairs.

Depending on business needs, DAO organizations can set up multiple skill groups, also known as guilds, which automatically create public chat channels and Kanban boards within my door. Users can choose to join a Congress that matches their expertise and is willing to contribute to it. Everyone here can decide what to do, what not to do, what projects to participate in, and what not to participate in.

We pass the substrate pallet and ink! Smart Contracts provide DAO templates:
1. RoadMap Target Management
2. DAO Share Management
3. Core Team, Association Management
4. Workflow Management (board/task)
5. Financial Management
6. Task reward management
7. Hot-plug voting management
8. Contribution Value, Medal Management
9. Hierarchical Management
